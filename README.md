# Computer Vision Repository


## Overview

This repository contains a special collection of Python notebooks I've curated on my incredible journey to develop a robust skill set in image processing and computer vision.

I've always been fascinated by the magic of computer vision â€“ how machines can interpret and understand the visual world as we humans do. As I delved into this captivating field, I encountered numerous challenges and exciting concepts that opened my eyes to the vast possibilities of image processing.

These notebooks result from countless hours of exploration, trial, and error. They represent my passion for gaining hands-on experience and understanding essential computer vision techniques. I've poured my heart and soul into creating practical examples to help you grasp these concepts quickly.

I've covered many topics in this repository, from basic image processing to advanced computer vision operations. Understanding these techniques will empower you to create stunning visual applications and bring your creative ideas to life.
Whether you're a curious beginner eager to explore the wonders of computer vision or a seasoned developer looking to refine your skills, you've come to the right place! Let's embark on this learning adventure together and unlock the magic of computer vision.


## Folder Structure

The repository is structured into the following folders:

1. [Image-Processing](https://github.com/mohdsaadoon/ComputerVision/tree/main/Image-Processing): This folder contains notebooks covering fundamental image processing techniques, including convolutions, color space conversion, image thresholding, morphological operations, and smoothing and blurring.
2. [OpenCV_surgery](https://github.com/mohdsaadoon/ComputerVision/tree/main/OpenCV_Surgery): In this folder, you'll find notebooks demonstrating basic computer vision operations, such as image loading, resizing, interpolation, text drawing, grayscale conversion, translation, rotation, flipping, cropping, image arithmetic, and splitting & merging channels.
