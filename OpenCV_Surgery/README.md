* [OpenCV_Surgery_101](https://github.com/mohdsaadoon/ComputerVision/blob/main/OpenCV-Surgery-Part-1/OpenCV_Surgery_101.ipynb) contains the Implementation of basic computer vision techniques such as loading images, resizing & interpolation, drawing text on an image, and converting an image to grayscale.
* [OpenCV_Surgery_102](https://github.com/mohdsaadoon/ComputerVision/blob/main/OpenCV-Surgery-Part-1/OpenCV_Surgery_102.ipynb) contains the implementation of translation, rotation, and flipping operations.
* [OpenCV_Surgery_103](https://github.com/mohdsaadoon/ComputerVision/blob/main/OpenCV-Surgery-Part-1/OpenCV_Surgery_103.ipynb) contains the implementation of cropping, image arithmetic, and splitting & merging channels.

*Hint:* The notebooks include images in the **HEIC**, Apple's standard image format. I recommend using [pyheif library](https://pypi.org/project/pyheif/) to work with these images effectively. This library lets you read HEIC files and convert them into widely supported formats like PNG or JPEG. If notebooks don't render on GitHub, copy the notebook's URL and navigate the structure using [NBviewer](https://nbviewer.org/).
