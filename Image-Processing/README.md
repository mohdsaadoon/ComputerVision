# Computer Vision: Image Processing

- The [Convolutions](https://github.com/mohdsaadoon/ComputerVision/blob/main/Image-Processing/Convolutions.ipynb) notebook includes all the components for comprehending how to implement Image Convolutions and Kernels.


- The [OpenCV Color Spaces](https://github.com/mohdsaadoon/ComputerVision/blob/main/Image-Processing/OpenCV_Color_Space_Conversions.ipynb) notebook provides an overview of color spaces, such as RGB (Red, Green, Blue) HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) LAB, YCrCb, CMYK and XYZ. The notebook also includes explanations for each of these color spaces.

- The [Image Thresholding in OpenCV](https://github.com/mohdsaadoon/ComputerVision/blob/main/Image-Processing/OpenCV_Image_Thresholding.ipynb) notebook gives an explanation of image Thresholding, such as Simple Thresholding, Otsu Thresholding, Adaptive Thresholding and Color thresholding.

-  The [Morphological Operation](https://github.com/mohdsaadoon/ComputerVision/blob/main/Image-Processing/OpenCV_Morphological.ipynb)notebook provides a comprehensive explanation of how to implement morphological operations and their techniques in image processing, for instance, Erosion, Dilation, Opening, Closing, Morphological gradient and Top hat (white hat) & black hat
